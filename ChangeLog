	* dbd_mysqllib.scm: use foreign pointer attribute to keep track of
	  whether a handle is already closed/freed or not.
	  This adds mysql-handle-closed? and mysql-res-closed? APIs.
	* dbd/mysql.scm: drop dependency to <dbi-object> and <dbi-result-set>.
	  Define dbi-open? method to query the low-level handle about
	  open/close status.  Fixed some bugs.

	* dbd/mysql.scm: adapted to the dbi api change.

2005-09-04  Shiro Kawai  <shiro@acm.org>

	* dbd/mysql.scm: slightly modified to follow the change in
	  util.relation.  Dropped relation-column-getter and implemented
	  relation-accessor, for the latter became the fundamental operation.
	  Dropped relation-column-setter, for it's better to keep the
	  result set read-only.
